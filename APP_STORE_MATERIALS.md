Think you're good with numbers? Prove it.

Calculator Game is the multiplayer estimation game where you and your friends compete to guess the closest answer to mind-bending numeric questions. From "How many steps are in the Empire State Building?" to "What's the population of Tokyo?" — every question is a race to be the most accurate.

HOW IT WORKS

One player asks a question with a numeric answer. Everyone else uses the built-in calculator to crunch their best estimate before time runs out. The closest guess wins a point. The furthest? Loses one. Simple rules, intense competition.

FEATURES

• Real-Time Multiplayer — Create a game and share your unique 6-character code with friends. No accounts needed, just jump in and play.

• AI-Powered Validation — Our smart AI verifies every question and provides accurate answers in real-time, ensuring fair play every round.

• Built-In Calculator — A full-featured calculator right in the game. Do the math, make your guess, hit submit.

• Flexible Game Modes — Play by rounds or race to a target score. Customize the number of rounds, point goals, and timer duration to match your group's style.

• Countdown Timer — A visual countdown keeps the pressure on. Watch the timer change color as seconds tick away.

• Live Standings — See how you stack up against the competition with real-time score updates and detailed results after every round.

PERFECT FOR

• Game nights with friends
• Family gatherings
• Road trips and travel
• Party icebreakers
• Remote hangouts over video chat

WHY YOU'LL LOVE IT

Calculator Game isn't about who knows the most facts — it's about who can make the smartest estimates. You don't need to know the exact answer. You just need to be closer than your friends.
